## About the Project
The goal of this project is to create a database of Major League Baseball players who became free agents following the 2021 season. This database will consist of metrics relative to each player's free agency; previous salary, projected salary, service time, etc. Once created, the database will use the metrics to determine their potential contracts with future teams. A front-end GUI will then be implemented for maintenance and query reporting. <br>
